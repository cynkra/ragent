\description{
Answer questions using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The function takes a
natural language query, searches through a knowledge base of documents, and provides
a contextually relevant answer based on the retrieved information. It uses a multi-step
process that includes generating follow-up queries to gather additional context.
